# TacoTour

**Taco Tour** is an engaging endless runner game developed with Unity, featuring an adventurous chihuahua named Taco and an agile cat named Tour. Created by 6 Summer Studios, this game invites players to skillfully switch between Taco and Tour to navigate a series of challenging obstacles. Taco, the chihuahua, has the ability to crouch and squeeze through tight spaces, while Tour, the cat, can jump higher to clear tall barriers.

As players progress, they can collect power-ups that enhance their gameplay experience. These power-ups include the ability to dash with Taco, enabling quick bursts of speed to avoid danger, and a revive option for Tour, allowing players to rescue the cat if it falls into a hole. With vibrant graphics, intuitive controls, and an exciting array of obstacles and power-ups, Taco Tour offers endless fun and challenge for players of all ages.

# Brainstorming and Conceptualization
Our dev team, 6 Summers Studio, consists of students from the Game Development program at NBCC in Miramichi, New Brunswick. We brainstormed ideas that would capture the attention of both young and adult casual players. After a lively debate, we settled on the concept of "Taco Tour," a game featuring a cute chihuahua named Taco who runs endlessly to find his way back home. Along the way, Taco meets Tour, a stray cat who helps him overcome obstacles, ensuring Taco's safe journey back home.

The game mechanics in **Taco Tour** include the ability for Taco to crouch and dash, while Tour can jump high and revive after falling into a hole. The endless path is dynamically generated, with platforms, ceilings, and obstacles meticulously placed to challenge the player. This design ensures that players must employ strategic thinking and quick reflexes to succeed.

As players navigate the ever-changing environment, they must skillfully switch between Taco and Tour, utilizing their unique abilities to overcome various challenges. The gameâ€™s difficulty increases progressively, keeping players engaged and on their toes. With its combination of strategic gameplay and vibrant, engaging visuals, **Taco Tour** provides an exciting and entertaining experience for all ages.
